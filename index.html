        The "Big Five" refers to five of the most iconic and majestic wild animals found in Kenya: the Lion, Leopard, Elephant, Buffalo, and Rhinoceros. Originally coined by big-game hunters, these animals are now prized sightings for wildlife enthusiasts and photographers. Kenya’s national parks and reserves offer the perfect opportunity to witness these creatures in their natural habitat.
